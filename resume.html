        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Calculated the subnet range of a newly configured ethernet interface, using C++, to check if it overlaps with the subnet range of other ethernet interfaces in the embedded system </li>
          <li>Developed a sorting program in C by using multiple child processes that have access to the same shared memory in order to increase the algorithm’s speed through parallel computation </li>
          <li>Controlled the state of an RGB LED by configuring and enabling interrupts and timers on the MSP432 controller using C, resulting in an efficient use of the CPU as opposed to polling</li>
          <li>Programmed a RaspberryPi in Python to control different electronic components in a circuit such as DC motors, LEDs, LCDs, buzzers, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Communication Skills</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Cooperated with team members on a project to discuss which tasks to take on and the approach for implementing the chosen design pattern</li>
          <li>Documented a program using a "ReadMe" file which provided users with instructions on how to use the program and additional resources such as contact information</li>
          <li>Illustrated the different views of a system by creating UML diagrams (class, use case, sequence, etc.) that improve understandability and guide the development process</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="display:inline">Embedded Test Automation and Software Developer</h3><h3 class="resume-project-date">January 2022 - December 2022</h3>
        <h3>Ross Video, Ottawa, ON</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Investigated a customer’s audio streaming bug by analyzing board logs and looking into the C++ ZeroMQ Socket API to provide my team with information on what’s causing the bug and potential fixes that can address the issue</li>
		  <li>Created design documents to propose new feature or performance related changes, receive feedback from team members on the design approach, and document my implementation</li>
		  <li>Automated manual regression tests by using Python and Selenium WebDriver to improve speed and accuracy while also adding the option to run the tests on other products</li>
		  <li>Revamped the design of loading content onto the WebUI, using JS and HTML, making the WebUI more responsiveness and eliminating the loading time when moving between sub-pages</li>
		  <li>Wrote a script that used the scp command to transfer WebUI files from the Linux virtual machine to the board, skipping the process of making a new firmware build and boosting my workflow’s efficiency</li>
		  <li>Improved the UI/UX of the WebUI by reorganizing the layout of different menus, utilizing cookies to remember user preferences, and adding a toggle switch for different color schemes</li>
		  <li>Prototyped and implemented a wizard setup page in the WebUI allowing users to quickly configure their boards and test out transmitting/receiving audio streams</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Visualized the relationship between different classes using UML class diagrams</li>
          <li>Proposed different GUI layouts to come up with an intuitive user-friendly design</li>
          <li>Applied the bottom-up approach to developing the program which allowed us to begin testing at an early stage</li>
          <li>Coded the test suite for the program using Junit and included a diverse set of inputs to address any corner cases</li>
		  <li>Detailed the functionality of the methods in a report and explained the design approach that we went with for the program</li>
